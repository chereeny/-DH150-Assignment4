## Step01: Main design challenge 


*What is the main activity your project would support the users?*
The main activity of this project will support users in trying to buy and sell items in an online marketplace website allowing users within the same area, or worldwide if they choose so, to communicate, discuss, buy, sell items. This will hopefully allow people to buy and sell unwanted items at a cheaper price than retail. However, this activity and interview will mainly focus on the searching and buying aspect of the overall activity. 

*What is the basic need involved for that activity?*
The basic need involved in this activity is physiological and the need for financial safety. This activity will allow people to acquire any items they need for their well being, for example, shelter, clothing, and transportation, fulfilling the physiological aspect of basic need. This activity will also fulfill the basic need for safety, specifically financial security, by allowing people to sell their unwanted items for money. 

*What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?*
The traditional means in satisfying these needs are large retail stores, general stores, online retail stores. However, for those who are looking to buy items at a cheaper price, they will go to online marketplaces. 

*What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?*
The limitations of buying and selling in person, which is the traditional method, is the need for transportation. Technology can help overcome limitations by providing online services, which many have now, and providing better means of communication. Additionally, a better filtering system of fake sites and sellers could be better eliminated with the use of modern day technology.




## Step02: Target users 


*What are the characteristics of users?*
The demographics of the users will be people who are over 18 since users will need to use a credit card in order to make purchases, and they must have access to a computer. The users will prefer this because people may not necessarily need a new item and a used item will be more resourceful. Used items will also come at a cheaper price, allowing those who prefer cheaper options to buy the same items.

*Where would the users do that activity?*
Users would do this activity anywhere where they have access to a device that can connect to the internet. After deciding on a deal, they will have to find a destination to do their buy and sell exchange. Majority of the users stay within a single area for easier opportunities in finding what they need.

*What would the users do to complete that activity?*
To complete this activity, the user must find an ad for an item they would like to purchase. They would then contact the person who posted the ad and discuss a reasonable exchange. They would then come to an agreement and decide on a location to meet up. Finally, they will meet up at the decided location and make their exchange. 




## Step03: Research methods


This activity will include two different observation methods, **ethnographic field research** and **participatory research**. 


## **Ethnographic research** 
This would allow the researchers to see the full process of the activity, from the searching to the actual meet up and exchange of the item. This will allow researchers to see what steps need improvement and what went well. 

Some of my observations include:
- Most people constantly look through different sites to find the cheapest and best option. 
- They try to find someone with a post that looks credible and provides a good amount of information.
- When making the exchange, they tend to select public places that are more crowded for safety reasons. 
- People stay in contact with several vendors in case one or some fall through.

### Interesting Quotes and insights from the interview:


*Participant on the credibleness of a large retail site.*

"They’re big and they have something to lose."


*How much time do you typically spend looking for items before you make a purchase?*

"Months"


*When you make your decision to buy the item, what factors are considered?*

" Price. Availability. How long the new ones will come out? "





## Reflection


During this process, I enjoyed how it showed the different processes that people have when doing the same task. This showed me that the way I maneuver through the internet to search for an item I want to buy is different from others. By collecting data such as the one above, allows researchers to understand how the human brain processes information. In turn, this will allow the creators to create and design products and sites that are easy and intuitive to use. Additionally, I enjoyed the participatory research because it allowed me to ask more questions for specific clarification. This also allowed me to delve more deeply into questions that would be helpful for future research and analysis. By doing the in person interview, I was able to get a clear idea of the user’s persona and his approach to the task.During the interview I was tweaking the script slightly according to the participant's actions. However, since I am new to interviewing people, I realized afterwards that there are things that I missed from the script or things the participant may not have answered properly. I would like to be able to become more comfortable in facilitating these tests in order to gather more information throughout the recording. I would have also liked to do more ethnographic field research by shadowing a participant going through the entire process of finding a post and actually buying the item. This will allow further extensive and detailed research of the entire process, giving more data to analyze and understand for a more improved product.
